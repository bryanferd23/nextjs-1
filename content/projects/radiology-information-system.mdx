- Billing integration and financial tracking

## Technical Architecture

### Backend (PHP)
```php
// Database connection and configuration
class DatabaseConfig {
    private $host = 'localhost';
    private $database = 'radiology_db';
    private $username = 'db_user';
    private $password = 'secure_password';
    
    public function connect() {
        try {
            $pdo = new PDO("mysql:host={$this->host};dbname={$this->database}", 
                          $this->username, $this->password);
            $pdo->setAttribute(PDO::ATTR_ERRMODE, PDO::ERRMODE_EXCEPTION);
            return $pdo;
        } catch(PDOException $e) {
            throw new Exception("Connection failed: " . $e->getMessage());
        }
    }
}
```

### Frontend (JavaScript/HTML/CSS)
```javascript
// Patient data management
class PatientManager {
    constructor() {
        this.apiBase = '/api/patients';
    }
    
    async createPatient(patientData) {
        try {
            const response = await fetch(`${this.apiBase}/create`, {
                method: 'POST',
                headers: {
                    'Content-Type': 'application/json',
                    'X-CSRF-Token': this.getCSRFToken()
                },
                body: JSON.stringify(patientData)
            });
            
            if (!response.ok) throw new Error('Failed to create patient');
            return await response.json();
        } catch (error) {
            console.error('Error creating patient:', error);
            throw error;
        }
    }
}
```

### Database Schema
```sql
-- Patients table
CREATE TABLE patients (
    patient_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    first_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    last_name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    date_of_birth DATE NOT NULL,
    gender ENUM('M', 'F', 'Other') NOT NULL,
    phone VARCHAR(20),
    email VARCHAR(255),
    address TEXT,
    created_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    updated_at TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP ON UPDATE CURRENT_TIMESTAMP
);

-- Procedures table
CREATE TABLE procedures (
    procedure_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    patient_id INT NOT NULL,
    procedure_type VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
    scheduled_date DATETIME NOT NULL,
    status ENUM('Scheduled', 'In Progress', 'Completed', 'Cancelled') DEFAULT 'Scheduled',
    radiologist_id INT,
    notes TEXT,
    FOREIGN KEY (patient_id) REFERENCES patients(patient_id)
);

-- Images table
CREATE TABLE images (
    image_id INT PRIMARY KEY AUTO_INCREMENT,
    procedure_id INT NOT NULL,
    file_path VARCHAR(500) NOT NULL,
    file_size BIGINT,
    upload_date TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    image_type VARCHAR(50),
    FOREIGN KEY (procedure_id) REFERENCES procedures(procedure_id)
);
```

## Implementation Highlights

### Challenge 1: DICOM Image Handling
**Problem**: Managing large medical image files (DICOM format) efficiently while maintaining image quality and metadata.

**Solution**: 
- Implemented custom DICOM parsing and validation
- Created image compression algorithms for storage optimization
- Built metadata extraction for proper image cataloging
- Developed secure image transmission protocols

- End-to-end encryption for data transmission
- Audit logging for all system activities
- Regular security assessments and penetration testing

### Challenge 3: Real-time Collaboration
**Problem**: Enabling real-time collaboration between radiologists in different locations.

```sql
-- Indexing strategy for fast queries
CREATE INDEX idx_patient_name ON patients(last_name, first_name);
CREATE INDEX idx_procedure_date ON procedures(scheduled_date);
CREATE INDEX idx_image_procedure ON images(procedure_id);

-- Partitioning for large datasets
ALTER TABLE images PARTITION BY RANGE (YEAR(upload_date)) (
    PARTITION p2022 VALUES LESS THAN (2023),
    PARTITION p2023 VALUES LESS THAN (2024),
    PARTITION p2024 VALUES LESS THAN (2025)
);
```

### Caching Strategy
- Redis for session management and frequently accessed data
- CDN integration for image delivery
- Database query result caching
- Application-level caching for static content
