# Getting Started with Next.js

Next.js has revolutionized the way we build React applications. In this post, I'll share my experience learning Next.js and why it's become my go-to framework for full-stack web development.

## Why Next.js?

Next.js provides several key benefits:

- **Server-Side Rendering (SSR)** for better SEO and performance
- **Static Site Generation (SSG)** for blazing-fast websites
- **API Routes** for building full-stack applications
- **Built-in TypeScript support** for better developer experience
- **Automatic code splitting** for optimized bundles

## Key Features I Love

### 1. File-based Routing

```javascript
// pages/blog/[slug].js automatically creates dynamic routes
export default function BlogPost({ post }) {
  return <div>{post.title}</div>;
}
```

### 2. API Routes

```javascript
// pages/api/posts.js
export default function handler(req, res) {
  res.status(200).json({ posts: [] });
}
```

### 3. Image Optimization

```jsx
import Image from 'next/image';

<Image
  src="/profile.jpg"
  alt="Profile"
  width={300}
  height={300}
  priority
/>
```

## Getting Started

To create a new Next.js project:

```bash
npx create-next-app@latest my-app
cd my-app
npm run dev
```

## Conclusion

Next.js continues to evolve and improve, making it an excellent choice for modern web development. Whether you're building a simple blog or a complex web application, Next.js provides the tools and performance you need.
